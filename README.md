## 🎯 Objective

### 🌍 **SafeHorizon: Bridging the Gap Between Crisis and Safety**

In times of disaster, every second matters — yet millions are left vulnerable due to slow warnings, fragmented information, and confusing communication.

SafeHorizon emerges as a next-generation solution, purpose-built to streamline disaster alerts, track past crises, and coordinate rapid response with precision.

We solve the critical problem of disjointed crisis communication and lost disaster data by providing:

- 🔔 **Instant, Verified Alerts**: Delivering real-time, reliable updates when it matters most.  
- 🕰️ **Historical Disaster Records**: Offering accessible, organized insights into past and recent disasters to help communities prepare smarter.  
- 🌐 **Unified Response Coordination**: Connecting individuals, authorities, and emergency teams through one seamless platform.  
- 📱 **Accessible, User-Friendly Design**: Empowering all users — even under stress — to make quick, informed decisions.  
- 🔒 **Focus on Trust and Safety**: Reducing misinformation, panic, and confusion at scale.  

Without SafeHorizon, communities face critical delays, lost knowledge, and higher casualty risks.  
With SafeHorizon, we light the path to safety, ensuring that help isn’t just hoped for — it’s organized, fast, and effective.

SafeHorizon isn’t just an alert system.  
It’s a lifeline — and a memory bank — for the moments that matter most.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name: **CODE-KRAFTERS**

### Team Members:

- Samith S Palan
- Prathyusha Paranjape
- Arjun Shenoy

### Why We Chose This Problem:

We chose this problem because it is highly realistic and can help countless people during disasters, potentially saving lives. SafeHorizon not only assists in real-time response but also helps researchers analyze disaster data for future preparedness and planning.

### Key Challenges Addressed:

- 🚨 **Live Disaster Updates**: Using the Groq API to deliver real-time updates.  
- 🚨🆘❗ **SOS Emergency Alerts**: Providing alerts with live locations to ensure faster response times.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Leveraging OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js to give users clear, real-time visuals of disaster areas.  
- 🌿💾 **MongoDB Database**: Storing user data and disaster information for accessible and organized retrieval.  
- 🌙☀️ **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Making the app adaptable to various user preferences, especially in stressful environments.  
- 🤖🧠 **Groq Assistant**: Using Groq to provide safety advice and detailed information about ongoing and past disasters.

### Pivots, Brainstorms, or Breakthroughs During Hacking:

During our hacking sessions, we introduced new features like OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js for advanced mapping capabilities and live location alerts to ensure that users and responders can be more informed and responsive. We continuously refined the user experience to make the system as intuitive and accessible as possible, especially under high-pressure situations.

This hackathon was a great learning experience.  
Throughout this project, we were introduced to multiple tech stacks, which expanded our knowledge and enhanced our skills in integrating diverse technologies. We're excited about the future and looking forward to adding even more features to our tech stack to make SafeHorizon more robust and impactful.
